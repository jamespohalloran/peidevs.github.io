Time for the year-in-review post! I figured August 2017 to August 2018 is arbitrary enough for such things.

This past year was the first one where PEI Devs had three consistent major sponsors. In addition to our first and fiercest supporter, Binary Star, both Forestry and Silver Orange stepped up and helped us. Without the three of them, our meetups this year wouldn't have happened.

We've had 11 regular speakers, and they've presented on topics ranging from picking up satellite signals, static site generation, EU privacy regulation and Augmented/Virtual Reality.

We also brought lightning talks back to PEI Devs from the dark recesses of 2015. In fact, we've had 2 lightning talk nights (February and August 2018). This is certainly something we may continue doing as we're getting around a half dozen volunteers each time we run a ligtning talk night.

One big event held in November 2017 was a surprising success. We held our first ever panel. The subject was "Hiring and Recruitment" and we had a big turnout for attendees and panelists. A big thank you to our panelists, Dustin Sparks, Jordan Patterson, Michael Gauthier, Ian Morse, Patrick Charles, and Wendy MacIntyre, for making the night a huge success!

We hope the next 12 months will be as interesting!
